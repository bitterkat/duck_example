    <h1>The Mallard Duck (from <a href="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mallard-duck/#mallard-male-swimming.jpg">Nat Geo</a>)</h1>
    <p>Mallard ducks are the most common and recognizable wild ducks in the Northern Hemisphere. You'll find them near ponds, marshes, streams, and lakes, where they feed on plants, invertebrates, fish, and insects. Mallards are dabbling, or surface-feeding, ducks because they eat by tipping underwater for food—head down, feet and tail in the air—rather than diving. Mallards also forage and graze for food on land.</p>

    <p>Another thing about ducks is that they waddle and that is delightful.</p>
    <p><i>jlc note: The Mallard ducks at UW Drumheller Fountain should be full of ducklings in a few months (if they can survive the evil crows, etc ...). The UW sets up an adorable duckling ladder for the ducklings to access the fountain.</i></p>
